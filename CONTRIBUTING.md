# Contributing :tada: <!-- markdownlint-disable-line no-trailing-punctuation -->

**Thank you for your interest!** All contributions are welcome. We feel this library will grow stronger from user contributions, so thank you for your time.

To maintain consistency across the code base (and minimize the introduction of bugs), we follow several guidelines. Every effort has been made to automate this for you using several tools so you can focus on adding features rather than fixing semicolons :smile:.

This page is meant to show you how to use these tools and what rules to follow when contributing code. Please read the following sections very carefully.
